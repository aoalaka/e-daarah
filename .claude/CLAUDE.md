### Design approach
- Design with a mobile-first approach prioritizing clean layouts and intuitive navigation
- Use a minimalist aesthetic with ample whitespace and clear visual hierarchy
- Maintain professional appearance through consistent typography and spacing
- Apply a restrained color palette (2-3 colors maximum) avoiding excessive gradients
- Use simple, functional icons sparingly - prefer text labels where practical
- Ensure all interactive elements have appropriate touch targets (minimum 44x44px)
- Implement responsive breakpoints that adapt naturally across device sizes
